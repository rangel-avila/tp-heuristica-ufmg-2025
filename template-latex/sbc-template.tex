\section{Introduction}
% Contextualization
In modern software development environments, organizations face increasingly complex challenges in managing the delivery of software features across multiple development cycles and deployment windows. Software teams must regularly decide how to group and schedule features for delivery, while respecting complex dependencies between components, modules, and functionalities. This real-world scenario mirrors a classic combinatorial optimization challenge, where limited resources (delivery windows, development capacity, testing environments) must be allocated efficiently while maintaining the correct execution order of interdependent tasks. The complexity intensifies when considering that resources often have sizes, priorities, and precedence relationships that cannot be violated during the delivery process.

% Problem Definition
The Bin Packing Problem with General Precedence Constraints (BPP-GP) can be formally defined as follows: given a set of items $N = \{1,2,...,n\}$ with associated weights $w_j$, a set of identical bins with capacity $C$, subject to a set of precedence constraints between item pairs that define their partial order relationships, the objective is to pack all items into the minimum number of bins, ensuring that no bin exceeds its capacity and that all precedence relationships are respected within a bin and across bins. This optimization problem extends the classical bin packing problem by incorporating ordering dependencies that are fundamental in software development contexts.

% Problem Characterization - Complexity Class
The Bin Packing Problem with General Precedence Constraints belongs to the class of NP-Hard optimization problems. This classification arises from the fact that even the basic bin packing problem without precedence constraints is NP-Hard, and the addition of these constraints only increases the complexity of the problem. The decision version of this problem, which asks whether there exists a feasible packing using at most $k$ bins while respecting all constraints, is NP-Complete, making it unlikely that polynomial-time exact algorithms exist to solve large instances of this problem.

% Problem Characterization - Similar Problems
Several related problems share structural similarities with BPP-GP, including the classical Bin Packing Problem (without precedence constraints), the Job Shop Scheduling Problem with precedence constraints, the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP), and the Knapsack Problem with Precedence Constraints. Furthermore, variants such as the Bin Packing Problem with Conflicts, where certain items cannot be placed in the same bin, and the Multidimensional Bin Packing Problem provide insights into techniques for handling constraints. The Strip Packing Problem with precedence constraints also offers relevant algorithmic approaches, particularly in the context of scheduling and resource allocation.

%  Problem Characterization - Additional Relevant Information
BPP-GP presents several unique features that distinguish it from standard combinatorial optimization problems. Precedence constraints create a partial ordering that can result in complex dependency graphs, potentially including parallel branches and multiple hierarchy levels. In software delivery contexts, these constraints may represent technical dependencies, business priorities, relationships between user stories, or testing requirements. The problem allows for intra-bin precedence (dependencies within the same delivery window) and inter-bin precedence (dependencies spanning multiple delivery cycles), significantly complicating the solution space and requiring sophisticated constraint propagation mechanisms.

% Motivation
This problem deserves investigation due to its direct applicability to critical challenges in modern software engineering and project management. As software systems become increasingly complex and development teams adopt agile methodologies with frequent delivery cycles, the efficient allocation of resources to delivery windows while respecting dependencies becomes fundamental to project success. Inadequate scheduling of resources can lead to development bottlenecks, release delays, inefficient resource utilization, and increased technical debt. Furthermore, the theoretical contributions of developing effective heuristics for BPP-GP can advance the broader field of combinatorial optimization with constraints and provide insights applicable to other domains, such as supply chain management, manufacturing scheduling, and resource allocation problems.

% Objectives
This research aims to design, implement, and rigorously evaluate a scalable, precedence-aware heuristic for the Bin Packing Problem with General Precedence Constraints. The objective is to combine efficient precedence propagation and packing strategies to minimize the number of bins while guaranteeing feasibility for both intra-bin and inter-bin dependencies. 

% Justification
The justification for this work lies both in its practical relevance and in the theoretical contribution it may offer. In practice, the optimization of software resource delivery under precedence constraints addresses a real need faced by development teams, where the complexity of manual scheduling often leads to inefficiencies and delays. From a theoretical perspective, the formulation and analysis of heuristics for BPP-GP expand the body of knowledge in combinatorial optimization under complex constraints, providing new perspectives that may be applied in domains beyond software engineering, such as logistics, manufacturing, and project management. Thus, the research is justified by its ability to generate direct impact on critical engineering processes while simultaneously strengthening the academic understanding of NP-Hard problems with additional constraints.

% Roadmap
The development of this work will follow a structured roadmap in progressive steps, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Literature review:} Research on BPP-GP problems, with a focus on heuristic algorithms applied to similar contexts;
    \item \textbf{Problem definition:} Formal definition of the problem, serving as the foundation for the design of the proposed algorithm;
    \item \textbf{Development of the heuristic algorithm:} Design of the algorithm with emphasis on mechanisms to efficiently handle precedence constraints;
    \item \textbf{Definition of the experimental methodology:} Planning of experiments and definition of parameters such as test instance generation, selection of evaluation metrics, and choice of comparative algorithms;
    \item \textbf{Execution of computational experiments:} Implementation and testing of the proposed heuristic algorithm on representative instances, with the goal of evaluating performance in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, comparing it with reference results from the literature;
    \item \textbf{Conclusions and future research directions:} Synthesis of the obtained results and final evaluation of the proposed heuristic for solving BPP-GP and its potential impact on optimizing software resource delivery. Discussion of achieved objectives and encountered limitations. For future research, potential avenues of continuation and deepening of the research will be indicated, whether through methodological improvements or applications in new scenarios.

% The first page must display the paper title, the name and address of the
% authors, the abstract in English and ``resumo'' in Portuguese (``resumos'' are
% required only for papers written in Portuguese). The title must be centered
% over the whole page, in 16 point boldface font and with 12 points of space
% before itself. Author names must be centered in 12 point font, bold, all of
% them disposed in the same line, separated by commas and with 12 points of
% space after the title. Addresses must be centered in 12 point font, also with
% 12 points of space after the authors' names. E-mail addresses should be

% before and 6 points of space after.

% The abstract and ``resumo'' (if is the case) must be in 12 point Times font,
